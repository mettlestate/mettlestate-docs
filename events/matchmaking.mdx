## Challenge-Based
- Players/teams can issue direct challenges (Battlegrounds).
- Availability windows are respected.

## Automated Pairing
- Takes into account skill, availability, and region where applicable.
- Avoids repeat pairings and enforces fair-play constraints.

## Why it matters
Balanced and timely matchups drive competitive integrity and player satisfaction.
