## Bracket generation
Brackets are generated automatically based on the seeding method. Admins can manually adjust the seeding and re-generate the bracket as long as the stage is not in progress. 
Admins are able to manually insert, update or remove players/teams in a stage at any given time.

## Promotion / Relegation
- Usually used during Leagues and Tournaments to move players between different stages of an event.
- Admins can define advancement paths between stages.
- Admins can set promotion and relegation rules for each stage.
- Admins can manually promote and relegate players between stages.
