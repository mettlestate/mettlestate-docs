## How it works

- Multi-format support: Battleground, Cup (once-off), League (seasonal), Tournament (multi-stage)
- Stages: Single/Double Elimination, 6-team Double Elim, Round Robin (single/double), Swiss, Battle Royale leaderboard, Racing leaderboard, Battlegrounds leaderboard
- Seeding: Automated or manual
- Progression: Automatic advancement/relegation between stages based on placement
- Check ins: Each competition requires players to check in to the event prior to the start of the event so that we can manage actual competitors per event. Should a registered player fail to check in, they will not be able to participate in the event

## Event Types

- **Battlegrounds**: Continuous challenge-based leaderboard where players/teams issue challenges
- **Cup**: Short, self-contained event
- **League**: Season-based competition with promotion/relegation between tiers
- **Tournament**: Bespoke multi-stage events combining groups and playoffs
