## Match Page

Each match has a page that displays the match details, participants, and results. <img src="/images/screenshots/match-page.png" alt="Matches" />

- Event: Name of the event the match is a part of
- Status: Current status of the match (`Pending`, `Scheduled`, `Active`, `Completed`)
- Round and Match: The round and match number of the match
- Best-of series (Bo1/Bo3/Bo5)
- Ends in: The time remaining for the match to be completed and results to be submitted

### Match Scheduling

- Players can propose schedules for their matches for some stage types:
  - Round Robin
  - Swiss
  - Battlegrounds
- Other stage types are scheduled by the admin
- Once proposed, the opponent can accept or reject the schedule
- If the opponent accepts, the match is scheduled and the players can join the lobby
- If the opponent rejects, the players can propose a new schedule
- If a player schedules a match and the opponent does not respond to the schedule within the stage deadline, the player who scheduled the match will receive an automatic win for that match
- If a match is not scheduled within the proposed time, both players will receive a forfeit for that match

### Match Results

### Match Chat

- Players can chat with each other during the match
- Admins can also chat with players during the match
- Chat is only available during the stage that the match is part of and before the match is completed
- Chat is only available for the players in the match and the admins

### Readying Up

<img src="/images/screenshots/match-ready-up.png" alt="Matches" /> Once a matches scheduled time has passed, the match becomes `Active`. Players are then required to `Ready Up`. This indicates to their opponent and the admins that the player is ready to play the match. If no results are submitted by the end of the match deadline, players who have not readied up will receive a forfeit for that match.
