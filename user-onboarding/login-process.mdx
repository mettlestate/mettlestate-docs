The login process in the Mettlestate Tournament Platform provides a secure, player-friendly authentication experience with comprehensive validation and error handling.

## Login at a glance

![login form](/images/screenshots/login-proccess.png)

- Open `/login`. If already signed in, you will be redirected to `/home`.
- Enter your playername or email and your password.
- Need help? Use "Forgot your password?". New here? Use the link to create an account.
- Submit to sign in. On success you land on `/home`; on error, an inline message prompts you to retry.

## Notes

- Protected pages redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
- Standard security and UX best practices are applied (input validation, secure sessions, basic rate limiting).
