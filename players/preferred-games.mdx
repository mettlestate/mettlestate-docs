Selecting up to 5 preferred games allows us to customise the experience of a player by priorising their preferred games when showing or suggesting events. This makes it easier for players to find events related to their preferred games as well as received any updates about new and upcoming events relating to their preferred games.

## Selecting Preferred Games

When first accessing the Mettlestate platform, a player will be prompted to select up to 5 preffered games. A player can change their preferred games at any time from their [Preferred Games Settings](https://mettlestate.com/profile/settings/preferred-games)
